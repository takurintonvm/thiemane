## Firefox

A Firefox version was available at the start of the project but has since become abandonware due to a lack of interest. The code's still in the repo if any intrepid souls should desire to bring it up to speed with the Chrome version.

## Awesome contributors

This project is much better now than it was at launch thanks to these people.
